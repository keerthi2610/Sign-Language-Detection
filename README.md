# Sign-Language-Detection
Sign language Translation using Object Detection API on google colabratory.

I have created a Sign Language Translator for the Ear impaired people (Deaf People) which translates the American sign language into English Texts.

This project is totally done on the google colabratory.

We have created a object detection model for sign language detection

The sign language detection API we used is Tensorflow ObjectDetection API and the pretrained model we used is SSD Mobilenet V2 FPNLite 320x320.

The camera accessing code in colab VM is also added.
